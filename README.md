# NW_Notetaker_app



## Description

The following application is a notetaker application that allows users to create and save notes. The application is going to be deployed to Heroku shortly. 

One of the problems I faced when building this application was using the incorrect control flow with the APIS, which resulted in an error with displaying the list of notes on the side of the page. Although the notes were being saved to my local db/JSON file, I had to resolve an issue in my code to get them to correctly display back onto the page.
